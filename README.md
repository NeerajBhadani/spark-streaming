# Data File
We will use some of the stock data available [here](https://github.com/szrlee/Stock-Time-Series-Analysis/tree/master/data). 
For example, Apple stock data present in this file: [AAPL_2006–01–01_to_2018–01–01.csv](https://github.com/szrlee/Stock-Time-Series-Analysis/blob/master/data/AAPL_2006-01-01_to_2018-01-01.csv).
 We will take the data for a few years like `2015`, `2016`, and `2017` and manually save it to a different file like `AAPL_2015.csv`, `AAPL_2016.csv` and `AAPL_2017.csv` respectively. 
 Similarly, we will create the sample data for `Google`, `Amazon`, and `Microsoft` as well. 
 We will keep all the CSV files locally under `data/stocks` folder. 
 Also, create another folder `data/stream` which we will use to simulate the streaming data.
